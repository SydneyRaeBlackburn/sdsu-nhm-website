                    <p>How can you have fun while simultaneously contributing to science? By joining the global citizen science movement. The Museum, independent naturalists, and outside organizations have created numerous citizen science projects aimed at helping scientists better understand the species that exists in any given region at any given time. Take part in the projects below to contribute to the exploration and creation of scientific knowledge. At The Museum, everyone is welcome to join in on the fun.</p>

                    <p>Help combat invasive species</p>
                    <p>They may be small, but shot hole borer beetles are doing big damage in San Diego. These pests threaten our fragile river woodlands by infesting willows and sycamores, leaving dead, broken trunks in their wake.</p>
                    <p>To help combat the damage being done by this invasive species, the SDSU Natural History Museum (The Museum) and the San Diego River Park Foundation are teaming up to monitor the beetle’s presence in the San Diego River Watershed—and we need your help!</p>

                    <h3>How you can help!</h3>
                    <p>We’re actively recruiting citizen scientists to help us set-up, check, and retrieve insect traps. Training will be provided—the only experience needed is comfort exploring the great outdoors, no formal background in science necessary. Three-day commitment required:</p>
                    <p>First Saturday October, 9 AM–2 PM: Training and trap deployment</p>
                    <p>First Saturday November: Mid-point tap check</p>
                    <p>First Saturday December: Collect traps, transport to The Museum, and analyze what you’ve found under a microscope</p>

                    <p>Picture a mass of hot molten magma spreading below the Earth’s surface. As it cools slowly into solid rock, steam concentrates into trapped pockets that cool slowly over millennia. Geologists know these pockets are where to find amazing minerals such as tourmaline, topaz, and beryl, as well as common ones like quartz, and mica.</p>
